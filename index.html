        Welcome to Environment Uncovered, a page that strives to keep Earth more healthy and green.
        We are devoted to educate people about pressing environmental issues in our world today.
        We intend to provide useful tips in order to make a better community for future
        generations. </p>

        Environment Uncovered is led by Sara Levin, Jennifer Porfirio, Kelsey Swasey and Bridget Lewis. Our team
        joined a Summer Immersion program called Girls Who Code. Girls Who Code is a non-profit organization that
        aims to increase the number of young women who major in computer science. We each learned outstanding skills during
        the first five weeks of the program and for the last two weeks, we were assigned to create a project using
        technology/coding skills that relates to real-world situations. Our group decided to create a website about
        environmental sustainability. We feel that many people lack knowledge of these environmental issues such as issues in ocean life,
        global warming, and pollution. We want people to help make their community more sustainable and eco-friendly for the future.
