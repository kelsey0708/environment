    <div class= "globalwarming"><h3><center>Global Warming</center></h3>
          <h5><div>-Global Warming is the gradual warming of Earth's climate that has been accelerated by human activity since the mid-twentieth century.
          Global Warming has been accelerated due to many human activities, but particularly, the burning of fossil fuels.</div><br><div>-The burning of fossil fuels
          releases greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane then become trapped in the atmosphere and make it difficult
          for heat to exit Earth's atmosphere causing a subsequent warming effect.</div><br><div>-Ever since the Industrial Revolution and increase of factory production, the amount of fossil fuels
          being burned has increased greatly.</div><br><div>-Others human activities such as deforestation have additionally contributed to the mounting climate change issue.
          Global Warming has caused many environmental changes that have had negative impacts on plants and animals.</div><br><div>-Just some of the destructive impacts of Global Warming include the
          melting of glaciers and because of this, rising sea levels, increased heat waves and droughts in some areas, increased precipitation in others, stronger hurricanes, and more.
          These events cause destruction to ecosystems that support countless forms of life and disrupt the lives of these plants and animals.</div></h5></div>

          <div class= "oceanlife"><h3><center>Ocean Life</center></h3>
            <h5><div>-Many environmental issues are caused by each other and then in turn cause more issues. This is certainly the case for issues with ocean life.
              Effects of Climate Change and pollution contribute to many issues facing ocean life now.</div><br><div>-Increased warming of the atmosphere due to Global Warming has resulted in
              much of this heat being absorbed by the ocean, which not only impacts the wildlife within these oceans, but also humans. Humans depend on the ocean as a major food source, so it is
              very important to take care of it.</div><br><div>-Additionally, as a result of Climate Change, there are increased carbon dioxide levels in the Earth's oceans which results in a gradual process called ocean acidification.
              Ocean acidification is the gradually increasing acidification of ocean waters that causes corrosion to ocean plants and harms life forms.<div><br></div>-Many ocean animals adapt to certain climates within their area and now
              because of Global Warming, their homes and routines are disrupted.<div><br></div>-Lastly, ocean pollution and increased garbage in the ocean is extremely dangerous for sea life. Animals can become entangled in garbage and can't move or they can choke
              on objects they think are food. It can be difficult for many animals to tell the difference between food and a harmful piece of garbage. Careless human activities are causing the disruption of ocean life and putting many life forms in danger.</div></h5></div>

              <div class= "parallax"></div>
              <div class= "pollution"><h3><center>Pollution</center></h3>
                <h5><div>-There are many different forms of pollution that are presently plaguing the Earth. One of the more prevalent of these forms is air pollution.<div><br></div>-Air pollution, caused by the releasing of toxic chemicals, is extremely dangerous to humans.
                  Toxic chemicals released into the atmosphere by factories become trapped in the air and in water supplies and are hazaradous for plants and animals. Overexposure to high amounts of air pollution can lead to many types of respiratory diseases and
                  even lung cancer for humans. Air pollution is mainly caused by the burning of fossil fuels, which also contributes to overall Climate Change.<div><br></div>-Additional types of pollution include water pollution, light pollution, and noise pollution.</div><br><div>-Water pollution,
                  as discussed in the ocean life section of our page, is caused by increased amounts of garbage in our oceans. This becomes dangerous for many animals in the ocean and damages many plants.</div><br><div>-Light pollution is caused by extreme amounts of light especially in cities. Light pollution
                  disrupts the human Circadian Rhythm, which dictates when we go to sleep and when we wake up. This disruption worsens sleep quality and can in small part contribute to cancer.</div><br><div>-Finally, noise pollution, especially in the Arctic, disrupts the routines of many animals. Loud noises from oil
                  and gas explorations in the Arctic disturb the feeding and breeding routines of certain types of whales and other various sea life.</div><br><div>-Many of these forms of pollution can't be detected by the human eye, but they are present and they are becoming huge issues for our societies.</div></h5></div>
